Recommendation ITU-T G.650.3
Test methods for installed single-mode optical fibre cable links

Summary
Recommendation ITU-T G.650.3 outlines the tests normally carried out on installed single-mode
optical fibre cable links. It includes a collection of references to the main measurement methods and
gives an indication of which are most suitable for installed cable links, depending on the required
inspection level. Optical fibre cable links are comprised of multiple cable sections, splices and other
connections. This term is more completely defined in this Recommendation.
This Recommendation uses a tiered approach. The first level indicates measurements that are normally
carried out to commission new optical fibre cable links. The second level indicates measurements that
may be carried out to satisfy service level agreements (e.g., when a dark fibre contract is signed) or to
verify attributes of older links that may be used at higher bit rates or over extended wavelength ranges.
Recommendation ITU-T G.650.3 (2017) introduces the provision of information of splice loss
measurement based on the quasi-bidirectional technique in Appendix IV. The method for
differentiating splice loss and macrobending loss in installed links, which was issued as Amendment 1
to ITU-T G.650.3 (2008), is also included as Appendix III.

Recommendation ITU-T G.650.3
Test methods for installed single-mode optical fibre cable links
1

Scope

This Recommendation describes test methods that are particularly suited to the characterization of
single-mode optical fibre cable links. The methods are not intended for application to links that
contain optical network elements, amplifiers, dispersion compensators, passive splitters or combiners.
Measurements associated with these devices in combination with optical fibre cable are defined in
ITU-T G.66x or ITU-T G.67x series Recommendations. These measurements of the cable links
between such devices and the calculation methods for combining the results of concatenated cable
links are also presented.
This Recommendation uses a tiered approach. The first level indicates measurements that are
normally carried out to commission new optical fibre cable links. The second level indicates
measurements that may be carried out to satisfy service level agreements (e.g., when a dark fibre
contract is signed) or to verify attributes of older links that may be used at higher bit rates or over
extended wavelength ranges.

Test methods

6.1

Test methods for characteristics of optical fibre cable links following installation

The purpose of testing an optical fibre cable link following installation is primarily concerned with
proving that the components used (fibres, connectors, etc.) meet their specifications and that the
installation has been carried out to a good standard of workmanship (e.g., splice losses meet their
specification and the cable link is free from damage).
Primarily, it is the attenuation characteristics of the optical fibre cable link that are commonly tested
as part of commissioning a new installation, as these are the characteristics that may be most affected
by the installation process and the quality of installation workmanship.
Rec. ITU-T G.650.3 (08/2017)

The criteria for newly installed optical fibre links are defined by the operating company. As an
example, for attenuation, these criteria may apply not only to the overall link attenuation, but also to
the individual cable sections and fibres, the individual splice and connector losses, and other
uniformity characteristics. One approach to defining the overall attenuation limit is to consider the
attenuation coefficient and length of the individual cable sections, the number of splices or connectors
and their maximum allowed losses, and combine the values according to the formulas of Appendix I
of [ITU-T G.652].
See clause 6.2 for additional testing that may be required for service contract requirements or for
higher (10 Gbit/s per channel and above) transmission rates, or for transmission over extended
wavelength ranges. [b-ITU-T G-Sup.40] is a guide on the relationship and definition of various
attributes and measurement methods found in ITU-T documents and the mapping to IEC documents.
6.1.1

Connector end face inspection

Before testing commences, it is recommended that the end face of the connectors at each end of the
link be inspected to ensure that they are clean and free from any damage. If there is any dirt present,
then the connector end face should be cleaned (according to the connector manufacturer's
instructions) in order to obtain reliable test results and satisfactory long-term performance. Following
cleaning procedures, the best practice is to re-inspect to ensure cleaning effectiveness.
Video inspection probes may be used to carry out this inspection safely with no risk to eyesight from
energized fibres. They also permit the inspection of the end faces of connectors installed behind patch
panels without risk of damage or interruption of traffic on other fibres.
End face images may be stored and analysed if required. [IEC 61300-3-35] provides acceptance
criteria for levels of damage and defects that may be tolerated without adverse effect on optical
performance.
6.1.2

Link attenuation

The link attenuation is very important for all applications regardless of data rate. It is usual to measure
the overall link attenuation at wavelengths that are representative of the wavelengths at which the link
will be operated. Commonly, this measurement is carried out at 1 310 nm and 1 550 nm, although, if
applications using the L-band (1 565 nm to 1 625 nm) are to be used, then testing at 1 625 nm is also
recommended (see [b-ITU-T L.313/L.66] on wavelength allocation for maintenance). The
recommended technique is to use a light source and power meter (LSPM) method as detailed in
[IEC 61280-4-2] to compare the power level injected at one end of the link with the power level
received at the other end of the link. The difference between these two power levels is the overall link
attenuation measured in decibels. Since this technique operates in the same way as the system
operates, it is the preferred technique for determining the total link attenuation. It may be a
requirement for this measurement to be carried out in both directions on every fibre in the link, since
it is not usually known at this stage which direction each fibre will operate in. Note, however, that
the total link attenuation should be similar in both directions when measured using this technique.
While insertion loss is the most fundamental attenuation measurement for links, the OTDR (see
clause 6.1.3) is often used either as a bidirectional measurement or as a unidirectional measurement.
The use of OTDR can shorten the measurement time, but also has risks. For either case, the OTDR
can, for example, miss a broken fibre near the end of the link, unless tail cords are used. It can also
allow crossed-over fibres to go undetected. It is well known that bidirectional OTDR measurement is
more accurate than unidirectional measurement, but unidirectional measurements are often done as
an initial check. When the results of such a check are marginal, follow-up with bidirectional
measurement is recommended. See [b-IEC/TR 62316] for more information on the interpretation of
backscattering traces.

4

Rec. ITU-T G.650.3 (08/2017)

If a complex link is to be formed by patching together a number of simple links, then the total
attenuation of the complex link is obtained by simply adding together the decibel attenuation figures
for each simple link.
6.1.3

Splice loss, splice location, fibre uniformity and length of cable sections and links

For these characteristics, the OTDR measurement method is recommended. Dependent upon the
measurement configuration, this method may also be used to measure the overall link attenuation.
This is described in [IEC 61280-4-2] for measuring the attenuation of installed links or in
[ITU-T G.650.1] for fibres and cables. An OTDR is an instrument able to measure the optical power
backscattered along a fibre as a function of distance. The detailed measurement technique, test
apparatus and measurement procedure are described in [IEC 61280-4-2].
Normally, for commissioning a new cable link, OTDR testing is carried out in both directions on
every fibre using at least two wavelengths. These wavelengths should be representative of the
wavelengths at which the fibre may operate, e.g., 1 310 nm and 1 550 nm for ITU-T G.652-type fibres
and 1 550 nm and 1 625 nm for ITU-T G.655-type fibres.
The OTDR testing should be carried out using a launch lead that is long enough (typically 1 km to
2 km) to allow measurement of the first connector in the link, a similar length tail lead should also be
connected at the far end of the fibre under test to allow the loss of the connector at the far end to be
measured.
Detailed analysis of these OTDR traces then allows accurate measurement of total link attenuation,
total link optical return loss, as well as a full breakdown of component losses along the link including
fibre section attenuation, splice losses, connector insertion and return loss. In addition, excessive
mismatches between fibres in different cable sections along the route can be identified, as well as any
problems, e.g., bends on the fibre. See Appendix I for examples of OTDR traces and their analysis.
If the OTDR is only used for length measurements or for overall attenuation checking of the cable
link using a launch lead and a tail lead, then unidirectional OTDR test results can be used. If more
careful evaluation of non-uniformities must be investigated, bidirectional OTDR test results need to
be considered as confirmation. See Appendix I for an example of bidirectional analysis.
In practical engineering, unidirectional OTDR test results can be used to roughly judge the splice
quality, but accurate splice loss measurement must be based on the bidirectional OTDR test. A
formula for calculation of splice loss is:

 A  B   B A
2
where
αA–B
αB–A

is the shown (not real) splice loss test from the A-end to the B-end of cable sections;
is the shown (not real) splice loss test from the B-end to the A-end of cable sections.

NOTE – OTDRs can be used to test cable attenuation for all link lengths supported by ITU-T applications,
dependent upon the performance of the OTDR used. Consult OTDR manufacturers' specifications for
suitability of OTDR modules for testing particular links. For concatenated cable links, the total attenuation can
be derived directly by summing the attenuations of individual cable links.

If the bidirectional OTDR test cannot be employed, the quasi-bidirectional test method can be
considered a candidate for measuring splice loss. It is noted that the quasi-bidirectional test is not
recommended as a standard method since it is challenging to deploy on existing networks. See
Appendix IV for an overview of the quasi-bidirectional test.
6.1.4 Measurements of other parameters needed following installation
The sheath isolation and the pneumatic resistance of the joint boxes are examples of tests that are
sometimes performed. These characteristics are not directly related to the transmission performance

of optical cable sections, but can affect the mechanical reliability. Standard tests for these attributes
have not been developed, but continue to be under study.
6.2

Test methods for verification of service contracts or transmission at particular bit
rates
This second level of testing, defined as fibre characterization, indicates measurements that may be
carried out to satisfy service level agreements (e.g., when a dark fibre contract is signed) or to verify
attributes of older links that may be used at higher bit rates (10 Gbit/s or above) or over extended
wavelength ranges [e.g., dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) in the L-band or coarse
wavelength division multiplexing (CWDM) over the O-, E-, S-, C- and L-bands].
In addition to the testing detailed in clause 6.1, fibre characterization also includes chromatic
dispersion (CD) and polarization mode dispersion (PMD) measurements, and may extend the
wavelength ranges covered by the attenuation-related measurements of clause 6.1, e.g., by including
1 625 nm OTDR testing or spectral attenuation measurements over the O-, E-, S-, C- and L-bands.
Fibre characterization is defined in clause 3.2.3. Often it is important to carry out full fibre
characterization, particularly on a dark fibre contract, because once the fibres are brought into service
it may not be possible to access the fibres again to assess their suitability for further upgrades in the
future.
6.2.1

Connector end face inspection

This is required in accordance with clause 6.1.1.
6.2.2

Overall link attenuation

This is required in accordance with clause 6.1.2. Measurements at additional wavelengths may also
be required.
6.2.3 Attenuation and related characteristics
For higher bit-rate transmission, the attenuation, splice loss, attenuation uniformity and section length
after cable installation also require verification. The test methods for these characteristics are the
backscattering technique; as described in clause 6.1.3. Measurements at additional wavelengths may
also be required.
6.2.4 Spectral attenuation
If the optical fibre cable link is to be used for CWDM applications, then there may be a wide variation
in the attenuation of the link across the broad range of wavelengths used. In this case, it is
recommended that the attenuation of the link be measured at all relevant wavelengths. This may be
achieved as described in clause 5.4.3 of [ITU-T G.650.1] using a suitable broadband light source and
an optical spectrum analyser to compare the input and output spectra of the link to determine the
attenuation as a function of wavelength across the wavelength range of interest. It is only required to
carry out this measurement in one direction on the link.
6.2.5 Polarization mode dispersion
For transmission rates lower than 10 Gbit/s or short distance transmission, measurement of the PMD
of cable links may not be required. [IEC 61280-4-4] provides a detailed description of the PMD
measurement of links, and further guidance on PMD measurements is given in [IEC/TR 61282-9].
There are several test methods identified in [IEC 61280-4-4] and [IEC/TR 61282-9] as being suitable
for measuring PMD of installed links. Particular care should be applied in selecting the method used,
depending on aspects such as whether the cable can move during the measurement.
It is sufficient to measure the PMD of the fibre in just one direction. The range of wavelengths used
should be representative of the wavelengths at which the fibres are utilized.

Rec. ITU-T G.650.3 (08/2017)

The above test methods can all be used to test individual cable links and some equipment may also
be used to test through amplifiers. For a complex link made up of a number of concatenated simple
links, the overall PMD can be calculated from the individual PMD values by adding them in
quadrature. This means that the total PMD of the complex link is the square root of the sum of the
squares of the PMD of the individual links. The detailed calculation method is described in
[b-IEC/TR 61282-3]. For example, if there are three simple links making up a complex link, then the
total PMD of the complex link can be calculated as follows:

PMDTotal 

Chromatic dispersion

CD measurement is not essential for a low bit-rate or short distance transmission, although it is useful
for identifying the type of fibre installed, i.e., ITU-T G.652-type fibre or the other fibre types.
NOTE – If the cable section is less than 40 km long to comprise an optical link used for 2.5 Gbit/s
transmissions, CD does not need to be tested. This measurement is conditional with respect to the planned bit
rate, transmission distance and fibre type.

For CD, there are a number of test methods that can be used. These are detailed in clause 5.5 of
[ITU-T G.650.1]. Field test equipment is available from a number of manufacturers for testing
installed links that implement the following test methods:
–
phase shift technique and differential phase shift technique;
–
time of flight technique including single-ended (OTDR based) and dual-ended methods.
It is not necessary for this measurement to be conducted from both ends of the link.
The wavelength range of the measurement should include the anticipated wavelength range of any
transmission systems that may operate over the link. For DWDM systems, it may be sufficient to
measure just the C-band or the C- and L-bands, however for CWDM systems, the wavelength range
should cover the full O-, E-, S-, C- and L-bands.
The above test methods can all be used to test individual cable links; also, some equipment can be
used to test through amplifiers as well as some types of dispersion-compensating modules. For a
complex link made up of a number of concatenated simple links, the overall CD (in picoseconds per
nanometre) at a particular wavelength can be calculated simply by adding the individual CD values
together. Note that for typical dispersion-compensating modules and for standard fibres operating at
wavelengths below their zero dispersion wavelength, the dispersion values will be negative. Further
guidance on calculating overall CD is given in clause 10.3 of [b-ITU-T G-Sup.39] and
[IEC/TR 61282-7].

Optical return loss

Two measurement methods for reflections of the optical path (optical cable sections) are described in
Appendix I of [ITU-T G.957]. One is with the optical continuous-wave reflectometer (OCWR) and
the other is with the OTDR. The OCWR gives a measurement of the total optical return loss (ORL)
of the entire link, whereas the OTDR provides reflectance measurements of discrete events, such as
connectors, as well as a calculation of the total ORL of the link. Further details of ORL testing of
fibre optic components may be found in [IEC 61300-3-6].

Appendix I
Optical time domain reflectometer trace analysis
(This appendix does not form an integral part of this Recommendation.)
I.1

Optical time domain reflectometer trace example

Figure I.1 shows an example of an OTDR trace taken at 1 550 nm of a link approximately 20 km
long. This link has been measured using a launch lead and a tail lead, each about 3.8 km long. The
cable sections in the link are generally about 2 km long, although there are a few shorter sections.
Note that the markers A and B are positioned to display the total loss of the link including the losses
associated with the connectors at both ends of the link.

Figure I.1 – Sample optical time domain reflectometer trace
I.2

Optical time domain reflectometer event table example

Table I.1 shows the complete analysis of the events on the trace shown in Figure I.1. Note that some
splices (e.g., event 5) are shown as having a negative loss. This is due to slight variations in the
backscattering characteristics of the fibre on either side of the splice. Where the fibre after the splice
scatters more light than the fibre before the splice, the apparent loss is reduced and may even show
up as an apparent gain. If the opposite is true (i.e., the fibre before the splice scatters more light than
the fibre after the splice) then the apparent loss may be larger than the true loss. This is the case for
the connector at the first patch panel (event 2) and for event 10 on Figure I.1 and Table I.1. This is
why it is necessary to carry out OTDR testing from both ends of the fibre using a launch lead and a
tail lead and to average the results bidirectionally. Some OTDRs allow this procedure to be carried
out in real time using an OTDR at each end of the link, otherwise this bidirectional analysis may be
carried out using PC-based software.

Optical time domain reflectometer bidirectional trace analysis

Figure I.2 shows a typical bidirectional OTDR display – the trace from Figure I.1 is shown reversed
and superimposed on the trace from the opposite end of the same fibre, so that the position of all of
the events correlates. Table I.2 shows the results bidirectionally averaged. Note for example that the
high loss splice that was event 10 in Table I.1 is now event 3, and there is a "gainer" (apparent negative
splice loss) when measured from the opposite end. Note also that the loss of the connector (now

averaged connector loss.

Appendix III
Method for differentiating splice loss and macrobending loss in installed links
(This appendix does not form an integral part of this Recommendation.)
III.1

General

When large loss is observed at a fusion splice point after cable installation by OTDR measurement,
it usually means that the loss is due to a low quality fusion splice or other causes, e.g., fibre
macrobending in a closure. Fibre macrobending in a closure is caused by rough fibre handling
following a fusion splice in a cable installation or by other causes, e.g., fibre axial strain.
Optical system performance might be degraded at longer wavelengths for an optical fibre cable link
with fibre macrobending. Hence, it is quite important to identify the location of fibre macrobending
for a cable link.
This appendix describes a simple method for differentiating splice loss and macrobending loss in
installed links. The method is based on OTDR measurement at two wavelengths and it is
recommended that a bidirectional OTDR method be used that can determine the exact loss at the
splice point. This optional method can be used to identify the main loss factor when large loss is
observed in an OTDR trace in the vicinity of a splice.
The application of the method is limited to ITU-T G.652-type fibres. A general application of the
method to ITU-T G.657-type fibres is difficult to implement, because of low bending loss, and is not
recommended.
Moreover, if the exact fibre types in the link are unknown, it is difficult to apply this method, since
the method is only effective for ITU-T G.652-type fibres.
III.2

Theory

III.2.1 Definition of macrobending indicator
Measurement of the macrobending indicator is based on an OTDR measurement at two different
wavelengths. The macrobending indicator, k, is defined as follows [b-Ryu]:

k  ( A1  A2 ) /( 1   2 ) (dB/nm)

(III-1)

In Equation III-1, it is assumed that OTDR measurement is performed at wavelengths of λ1 and λ2 (in
nanometres) and that the measured loss at a fibre splice point at each wavelength is A1 and A2 (in
decibels), respectively. Wavelengths λ1 and λ2 should be set at values longer than the cable cut-off
wavelength.
Figure III.1 shows examples of the calculation results of the macrobending indicator using the theory
of [b-Marcuse, 1976] and [b-Sharma] when a fibre is wound one turn with a radius of R (in
millimetres). In the calculation, λ1 was fixed at 1 310 nm and λ2 was changed as shown on the
horizontal axis.

Rec. ITU-T G.650.3 (08/2017)

13

Figure III.1 – Macrobending indicator vs wavelength (λ2)
for various bending radii (λ1 = 1 310 nm)
From Figure III.1, it is clear that as λ2 increases, the macrobending indicator becomes larger, which
means that the detection sensitivity of macrobending has improved.
III.2.2 Features of macrobending indicator
As described in Appendix I, in the OTDR measurement, accurate loss values can be derived by
averaging bidirectional measurement results. The necessity for bidirectional measurement is due to
different Rayleigh backscattering coefficients of the spliced fibres.
Figure III.2 shows an OTDR set-up for measuring the macrobending indicator. In the set-up, Fibre A
and Fibre B are spliced. Macrobending exists on the Fibre B side.

Figure III.2 – Measurement set-up of macrobending indicator
Here it is assumed that the OTDR measurement is carried out from side A and that PAi is optical
power immediately before the splice point at a wavelength λi (i = 1, 2), and PBi is power right after
the point with macrobending. It is also assumed that the splice loss for this case is negligibly small.
Rayleigh backscattering coefficients for fibre A and fibre B at a wavelength λi are assumed to be αAi
and αBi, respectively. It is well known that αAi and αBi are inversely proportional to 4i , so that they
can be expressed as:
 A i   A / 4i

(III-2)

 Bi   B / 4i

(III-3)

The loss Ai at a wavelength λi can be derived as:

14

Rec. ITU-T G.650.3 (08/2017)

Ai  10 log10 Ai PAi  / Bi PBi   10 log10 A PAi  / B PBi 

(III-4)

From Equations III-1 and III-4, the macrobending indicator becomes:

k  10 log10 ( PA1 / PB1 )  10 log10 ( PA2 / PB2 ) 1   2 

(III-5)

In Equation III-5, the influence of the Rayleigh backscattering coefficient has been cancelled due to
the differential operation in the definition of k. Equation III-5 shows that k is only dependent on the
exact power before and after the fibre macrobending point at each wavelength.
The results above show that bidirectional measurement is not necessary for the determination of k.
This feature is quite important, since it is not always easy to perform OTDR measurement from both
sides of the cable because both end points are at different locations geographically.
Then a case with the splice loss is taken into account. Regarding the splice loss, if the fibres with a
different mode field diameter (MFD) are spliced, the loss due to MFD mismatch is observed. The
influence of the loss-increase due to MFD mismatch is discussed in clause III.4.2. Figure III.3
shows a measurement configuration for such a case.

Figure III.3 – Macrobending indicator measurement set-up
with both macrobending and splice loss
The optical power PAi and PBi are assumed as in Figure III.2. ASi and AMi denote the loss due to the
splice and macrobending, respectively. The macrobending indicator k becomes:

k  ( AS1  AS2 ) / 1   2   ( AM1  AM2 ) / 1   2 

(III-6)

The macrobending indicator due to the splice loss is defined as:

kS  ( AS1  AS2 ) / 1   2 

(III-7)

and that due to the macrobending is:

kM  ( AM1  AM2 ) / 1   2 

(III-8)

From Equations III-6, III-7, and III-8:

k  kS  kM

(III-9)

From Equation III-9, it can be said that the total macrobending indicator is the summation of both
contributions.
III.3

Considerations on practical applicability

This clause discusses a practical detection limit of the macrobending indicator. Regarding
conventional OTDR systems, the detection limit of optical loss is δ (dB) considering the accuracy of
the OTDR equipment.
The detection limit of the macrobending indicator kmin can be expressed as:

Rec. ITU-T G.650.3 (08/2017)

15

kmin    2  1  (dB/nm)

(III-10)

Figure III.4 shows applicable measurement conditions of the macrobending indicator with one turn
for various bending radii when δ is assumed to be 0.1 (dB), considering the accuracy of the
conventional OTDR measurement.

Figure III.4 – Applicable measurement conditions
It can be made clear from Figure III.4 that as λ2 becomes longer, the macrobending with a larger
radius can be detected. In other words, the detection sensitivity becomes improved for longer λ2.
From Figure III.4, an approximate detection limit of the maximum bending radius can be summarized
as in Table III.1.

Measurement examples and influence of various conditions on measurement results

In this clause, some measurement examples are shown in terms of the influence of various conditions
on the measurements results.
III.4.1 High splice loss
Table III.2 shows splice loss of two ITU-T G.652-type fibres when they are spliced with the fibre
core axis misalignment to emulate a large splice loss condition. It is known from Table III.2 that
splice loss decreases as the wavelength becomes longer. This is because at longer wavelength the
MFD becomes larger, thus the loss increase due to the core axis misalignment is alleviated.
Figure III.5 shows the macrobending indicator calculated from Table III.2. It can be seen from
Figure III.5 that the macrobending indicator becomes a negative value due to the reasons above. In
this case, applicable measurement conditions in Figure III.4 may be degraded since the macrobending
indicator is the summation of both splice and macrobending losses as shown in Equation III-9.

III.4.2 Mode field diameter mismatch
This clause discusses the influence of the MFD mismatch on the macrobending indicator, since the
MFD of the commercial ITU-T G.652-type fibres is different from one fibre to another as long as the
MFD is within the specified values in [ITU-T G.652].
According to [ITU-T G.652], the MFD at 1 310 nm of G.652.B is specified as follows:
–
range of nominal values: 8.6 µm to 9.5 µm;
–
tolerance: ±0.6 µm.
So, for the consideration of the influence of the MFD mismatch, it is sufficient to consider the MFD
range 8.0 µm to 10.1 µm.
Figure III.6 shows the calculation results of the macrobending indicator considering the splice loss
theory of [b-Marcuse, 1977] when fibres with MFD of 8.0 µm and 10.1 µm are spliced.

Figure III.6 – Macrobending indicator when different mode field diameter fibres are spliced
Rec. ITU-T G.650.3 (08/2017)

17

From Figure III.6, it can be seen that the macrobending indicator becomes a negative value, and the
minimum value is about −0.000 25 dB/nm. The absolute value of the macrobending indicator is fairly
small as compared with the detection limit discussed in clause III.3. Hence, it can be concluded that
the influence of the MFD mismatch on the macrobending indicator can be neglected in practical
applications.

Appendix IV
Splice loss measurement using quasi-bidirectional technique
(This appendix does not form an integral part of this Recommendation.)
IV.1

Introduction

This appendix introduces test methods for measuring splice loss by the quasi-bidirectional technique.
These test methods are considered when the bidirectional OTDR test cannot be employed in the field.
There are two quasi-bidirectional methods that can be used for an accurate evaluation of splice loss,
and they are based on OTDR of [b-Di Vita] and Brillouin time domain analysis (BOTDA) of
[b-Takahashi, 2014a] and [b-Takahashi, 2014b] techniques. Both methods can obtain bidirectional
information from measurement results assisted by the end-reflection of the fibre. The methods are not
recommended as standard methods, since it is challenging to deploy them on existing networks. They
often require a reflector at the fibre-end and more complicated test apparatus than a conventional
OTDR test.
IV.2

Test method using quasi-bidirectional technique

IV.2.1 End-reflection assisted optical time domain reflectometer
IV.2.1.1 General
In OTDR testing, Rayleigh backscattering generated by a probe pulse propagating in a fibre link is
recognized as a unidirectional OTDR trace. When there is a strong reflection at the far end of the
fibre, Rayleigh backscattering generated by the reflected probe pulse is also reflected at the far end,
and then detected as a signal. This is called a second order backscatter trace (often called a ghost
trace), and it appears after the unidirectional (namely first order) OTDR trace. It is emphasized that
these traces contain information on opposite directions of the fibre link between first and second order
traces.
Figure IV.1 shows a schematic of the use of an end-reflection assisted OTDR.

Figure IV.1 – Schematic of the use of an of end-reflection assisted
optical time domain reflectometer

IV.2.1.2 Test apparatus
The test apparatus is shown in Figure C.1 of [IEC 60793-1-40].

Rec. ITU-T G.650.3 (08/2017)

19

The method requires a high dynamic range as regards OTDR performance, because the OTDR probe
pulse experiences round-trip propagation with twice the total attenuation of the fibre link and the
return loss of the end-reflection. An end-reflection with higher reflectivity (~100%) is desirable in
terms of obtaining the second backscatter trace more effectively. It is noted that the tail of the pulse
recovery at the strong reflection does not allow the characterization of the splice loss near the
reflective end. Otherwise, a specially designed OTDR with a short recovery time would be needed.
IV.2.1.3 Measurement procedure
Figure IV.2 shows an example of the result obtained with an end-reflection assisted OTDR. The true
splice loss can be determined by taking the average of two events at symmetrical positions, based on
the fibre-end reflection from the OTDR trace on a logarithmic scale.
Further information about this method can be found, for example, in [b-Gold].

Figure IV.2 – Example result with an end-reflection assisted optical
time domain reflectometer
IV.2.2 End-reflection assisted Brillouin time domain analysis
IV.2.2.1 General
It is known that Brillouin gain analysis can also be used for loss distribution measurement
[b-Horiguchi]. If pump and probe pulses with an optical frequency difference of 10 GHz to 11 GHz
collide in a fibre, the probe pulse is amplified by Brillouin gain. Conceptually, the loss distribution
can be analysed from the gain distribution, since the Brillouin gain reflects the loss experienced by
the pump pulse. The fundamental difference compared with OTDR approaches is that this method is
not based on a backscattering technique, and uses the probe pulse reflected at the fibre-end.
Figure IV.3 shows a schematic of end-reflection assisted BOTDA.

20

Rec. ITU-T G.650.3 (08/2017)

Figure IV.3 – Schematic of end-reflection assisted Brillouin time domain analysis
IV.2.2.2 Test apparatus
Figure IV.4 shows the test apparatus used for end-reflection assisted BOTDA. It consists of a
distributed feedback (DFB) laser, frequency and intensity modulators, a pulse generator and
polarization controllers. The frequency modulator is used to control the frequency difference between
the pump and the probe pulses. The intensity modulators and the pulse generator can change the time
delay, t, with which the pump and probe pulses are launched into the fibre. The polarization
scrambler changes the polarization state between the pump and probe pulses. The narrow-band optical
filter eliminates the reflected pump pulse to be detected.
The positive and negative values of t are for the probe-pump and pump-probe modes, respectively.
The time delay, t, is changed from 2L/v to −2L/v, where L is the link length and v is the light velocity
in the fibre. The spatial resolution of the loss distribution is given by vTp/2 (Tp is the pulse width of
the pump pulse).
Although this method is not affected by the problem of the pulse recovery as seen in OTDR
approaches, since it acquires the Brillouin gain on the probe pulse, it requires more complicated test
apparatus than the conventional OTDR test method. This method requires frequency shift averaging
at 10 GHz to 11 GHz by changing the optical frequency of the probe or pump at the frequency
modulator in order to avoid the influence of parameters such as the fibre type and temperature versus
strain distribution in the fibre link.

IV.2.2.3 Measurement procedure
The measurement procedure is as follows.
a)
Align the fibre under test with the optical coupling system.
b)
Measure the power of the reflected probe pulse without the pump pulse.
c)
Measure the power of the reflected probe pulse for N iterations, while changing the time
delay for the scanning collision points between the pump and the probe pulses along the fibre
under test. N is the averaging number.
d)
Analyse the gain distribution from the difference between the reflected probe powers in
steps b) and c).
e)
Change the optical frequency of either the probe or pump, and repeat steps b) to e).
f)
Average the gain distributions of step e).
g)
Obtain the true splice loss from two averaged symmetrical events based on the fibre-end
reflection (t = 0) from the trace on the logarithmic scale.
Figure IV.5 shows an example of the results. The apparent gain or loss events on the trace are
observed at the splices between ITU-T G.652- and ITU-T G.657-type fibres. The true splice losses
are obtained as 0.21 dB for splice A and 0.41 dB for splice B.
Figure IV.6 compares results for four splices obtained by OTDR and end-reflection assisted BOTDA.
The horizontal and vertical axes show the results obtained by bidirectional OTDR and end-reflection
assisted BOTDA, respectively. The solid line shows the agreement between both splice loss values.
With unidirectional OTDR, there was a discrepancy of more than ±0.3 dB. The results obtained with
the end-reflection assisted BOTDA were in good agreement with those obtained using bidirectional
OTDR measurement with a discrepancy of less than ±0.1 dB.
