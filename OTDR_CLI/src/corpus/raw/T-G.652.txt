Recommendation ITU-T G.652
Characteristics of a single-mode optical fibre and cable

Summary
Recommendation ITU-T G.652 describes the geometrical, mechanical and transmission attributes of
a single-mode optical fibre and cable which has zero-dispersion wavelength around 1310 nm. The
ITU-T G.652 fibre was originally optimized for use in the 1310 nm wavelength region, but can also
be used in the 1550 nm region. This is the latest revision of a Recommendation that was first created
in 1984 and deals with some relatively minor modifications. This revision is intended to maintain the
continuing commercial success of this fibre in the evolving world of high-performance optical
transmission systems.

This revision clarified the nomenclature for the different categories or fibre. Also, in
accordance with the agreement on spectral band description, the upper limit of the
L-band is changed from 16XX to 1625 nm. The attenuation characteristics for reduced
water peak categories, (G.652.C and G.652.D) are generalized to a broad region from a
single wavelength. PMD requirements are added for all categories and two categories
have reduced limits (compared to 0.5 ps/ km ). For the macrobending test, mandrel
diameter is reduced to 30 mm radius. As seen above, this Recommendation has
evolved considerably over the years; therefore the reader is warned to consider the
appropriate version to determine the characteristics of already deployed product,
taking into account the year of production. In fact, products are expected to comply
with the Recommendation that was in force at the time of their manufacture, but may
not fully comply with subsequent versions of the Recommendation.

Version 7

(06/2005)

Support of G.695 applications is noted.
A clarification of the method of fitting chromatic dispersion coefficient values and
their use is provided in 5.10, along with some text on use of the statistics of chromatic
dispersion for system design.
A clarification of the relationship of the PMDQ of uncabled fibre to cabled fibre is
provided in 6.2.
In the tables of requirements:
The uncabled fibre PMD line item is removed from the tables and the note on the
requirement for uncabled fibre PMD is modified.
The tolerance of MFD at 1310 nm is reduced.
The maximum dispersion slope at the zero dispersion wavelength is reduced.
The maximum concentricity error is reduced.
The maximum macrobending loss is reduced.
The wording for the water peak requirement in Tables 3 and 4 are modified to reflect a
reference to the specification over the range vs the specification at 1310 nm.

Recommendation ITU-T G.652
Characteristics of a single-mode optical fibre and cable
1

Scope

This Recommendation describes a single-mode optical fibre and cable which has zero-dispersion
wavelength around 1310 nm and which is optimized for use in the 1310 nm wavelength region, and
which can also be used in the 1550 nm region (where this fibre is not optimized). Both analogue
and digital transmission can be used with this fibre.
The geometrical, optical, transmission and mechanical parameters are described below in three
categories of attributes:
•
fibre attributes are those attributes that are retained throughout cabling and installation;
•
cable attributes that are recommended for cables as they are delivered;
•
link attributes that are characteristic of concatenated cables, describing estimation methods
of system interface parameters based on measurements, modelling or other considerations.
Information for link attributes and system design are in Appendix I.
This Recommendation and the different performance categories found in the tables of clause 7 are
intended to support the following related system Recommendations:
•
[ITU-T G.957].
•
[ITU-T G.691].
•
[ITU-T G.692].
•
[ITU-T G.693].
•
[ITU-T G.959.1].
•
[ITU-T G.695].
NOTE – Depending on the length of the links, dispersion accommodation can be necessary for some
ITU-T G.691, ITU-T G.692 or ITU-T G.959.1 application codes.

The meaning of the terms used in this Recommendation and the guidelines to be followed in the
measurement to verify the various characteristics are given in [ITU-T G.650.1] and
[ITU-T G.650.2]. The characteristics of this fibre, including the definitions of the relevant
parameters, their test methods and relevant values, will be refined as studies and experience
progress.

Fibre attributes

Only those characteristics of the fibre providing a minimum essential design framework for fibre
manufacture are recommended in this clause. Ranges or limits on values are presented in the tables
of clause 7. Of these, cable manufacture or installation may significantly affect the cabled fibre
cut-off wavelength and PMD. Otherwise, the recommended characteristics will apply equally to
individual fibres, fibres incorporated into a cable wound on a drum, and fibres in an installed cable.
5.1

Mode field diameter

Both a nominal value and tolerance about that nominal value shall be specified at 1310 nm. The
nominal value that is specified shall be within the range found in clause 7. The specified tolerance
shall not exceed the value in clause 7. The deviation from nominal shall not exceed the specified
tolerance.
5.2

Cladding diameter

The recommended nominal value of the cladding diameter is 125 μm. A tolerance is also specified
and shall not exceed the value in clause 7. The cladding deviation from nominal shall not exceed the
specified tolerance.
5.3

Core concentricity error

The core concentricity error shall not exceed the value specified in clause 7.
5.4

Non-circularity

5.4.1

Mode field non-circularity

In practice, the mode field non-circularity of fibres having nominally circular mode fields is found
to be sufficiently low that propagation and jointing are not affected. It is, therefore, not considered
necessary to recommend a particular value for the mode field non-circularity. It is not normally
necessary to measure the mode field non-circularity for acceptance purposes.
5.4.2

Cladding non-circularity

The cladding non-circularity shall not exceed the value found in clause 7.
5.5

Cut-off wavelength

Two useful types of cut-off wavelength can be distinguished:
a)

cable cut-off wavelength λcc;

b)

fibre cut-off wavelength λc.

NOTE – For some specific submarine cable applications, other cable cut-off wavelength values may be
required.

The correlation of the measured values of λc and λcc depends on the specific fibre and cable design
and the test conditions. While in general λcc < λc, a general quantitative relationship cannot be
easily established. The importance of ensuring single-mode transmission in the minimum cable
length between joints at the minimum operating wavelength is paramount. This may be performed
by recommending the maximum cable cut-off wavelength λcc of a cabled single-mode fibre to be
1260 nm or for worst case length and bends, by recommending a maximum fibre cut-off
wavelength to be 1250 nm.
The cable cut-off wavelength, λcc, shall be less than the maximum specified in clause 7.

Rec. ITU-T G.652 (11/2009)

5.6

Macrobending loss

Macrobending loss varies with wavelength, bend radius and number of turns about a mandrel with a
specified radius. Macrobending loss shall not exceed the maximum given in clause 7 for the
specified wavelength(s), bend radius and number of turns.
NOTE 1 – A qualification test may be sufficient to ensure that this requirement is being met.
NOTE 2 – The recommended number of turns corresponds to the approximate number of turns deployed in
all splice cases of a typical repeater span. The recommended radius is equivalent to the minimum
bend-radius widely accepted for long-term deployment of fibres in practical systems installations to avoid
static-fatigue failure.
NOTE 3 – If, for practical reasons, fewer than the recommended number of turns are chosen to be
implemented, it is suggested that not less than 40 turns, and that a proportionately smaller loss increase be
required.
NOTE 4 – The macrobending loss recommendation relates to the deployment of fibres in practical
single-mode fibre installations. The influence of the stranding-related bending radii of cabled single-mode
fibres on the loss performance is included in the loss specification of the cabled fibre.
NOTE 5 – In the event that routine tests are required, a smaller diameter loop with one or several turns can
be used instead of the recommended test, for accuracy and measurement ease. In this case, the loop diameter,
number of turns and the maximum permissible bend loss for the several-turn test should be chosen so as to
correlate with the recommended test and allowed loss.

5.7

Material properties of the fibre

5.7.1

Fibre materials

The substances of which the fibres are made should be indicated.
NOTE – Care may be needed in fusion splicing fibres of different substances. Provisional results indicate
that adequate splice loss and strength can be achieved when splicing different high-silica fibres.

5.7.2

Protective materials

The physical and chemical properties of the material used for the fibre primary coating and the best
way of removing it (if necessary) should be indicated. In the case of single-jacketed fibre, similar
indications shall be given.
5.7.3

Proofstress level

The specified proofstress σp shall not be less than the minimum specified in clause 7.
NOTE – The definitions of the mechanical parameters are contained in clauses 3.2 and 5.6 of
[ITU-T G.650.1].

5.8

Refractive index profile

The refractive index profile of the fibre does not generally need to be known.
5.9

Longitudinal uniformity of chromatic dispersion

Under study.
NOTE – At a particular wavelength, the local absolute value of the chromatic dispersion coefficient can vary
away from the value measured on a long length. If the value decreases to a small value at a wavelength that
is close to an operating wavelength in a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) system, four-wave mixing
can induce the propagation of power at other wavelengths including, but not limited to, other operating
wavelengths. The magnitude of the four-wave mixing power is a function of the absolute value of the
chromatic dispersion coefficient, the chromatic dispersion slope, the operating wavelengths, the optical
power, and the distance over which four-wave mixing occurs.

4

Rec. ITU-T G.652 (11/2009)

For dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) operations in the 1550 nm region, the chromatic
dispersion of ITU-T G.652 fibres is large enough to avoid four-wave mixing. Chromatic dispersion
uniformity is, therefore, not a functional issue.

5.10

Chromatic dispersion coefficient

The measured group delay or chromatic dispersion coefficient versus wavelength shall be fitted by
the three-term Sellmeier equation as defined in Annex A of [ITU-T G.650.1] (see clause 5.5 of
[ITU-T G.650.1] for guidance on the interpolation of dispersion values to unmeasured
wavelengths).
The Sellmeier equation can be used to fit the data in each range (1310 nm and 1550 nm) separately
in two fits, or as one common fit, with data from both ranges.
The Sellmeier fit in the 1310 nm region may not be sufficiently accurate when extrapolated to the
1550 nm region. Because the chromatic dispersion in the latter region is large, the reduced accuracy
may be acceptable; if not, it can be improved by including data from the 1550 nm region when
performing the common fit, or by using a separate fit for the 1550 nm region. It should be noted that
a common fit may reduce the accuracy in the 1310 nm region.
The chromatic dispersion coefficient, D, is specified by putting limits on the parameters of a
chromatic dispersion curve that is a function of wavelength in the 1310 nm region. The chromatic
dispersion coefficient limit for any wavelength, λ, is calculated with the minimum zero-dispersion
wavelength, λ0min, the maximum zero-dispersion wavelength, λ0max, and the maximum
zero-dispersion slope coefficient, S0max, according to:

The values of λ0min, λ0max and S0max shall be within the limits indicated in the tables of clause 7.
The chromatic dispersion coefficient values at wavelengths ranging from 1500 nm to 1625 nm are
also used in system design or chromatic dispersion compensator design. Chromatic dispersion
coefficient values at selected wavelengths in this range are evaluated by using either the five-term
Sellmeier or the fourth order polynomial model based on measurements across these wavelength
ranges. Designs with chromatic dispersion coefficient values are normally based on a statistical
approach such as that found in Supplement 39 to ITU-T G-series Recommendations. Appendix I
lists typical values for a band about 1550 nm.
NOTE – It is not necessary to measure the chromatic dispersion coefficient of single-mode fibre on a routine
basis.

6

Cable attributes

Since the geometrical and optical characteristics of fibres given in clause 5 are barely affected by
the cabling process, this clause gives recommendations mainly relevant to transmission
characteristics of cabled factory lengths.
Environmental and test conditions are paramount and are described in the guidelines for test
methods.
6.1

Attenuation coefficient

The attenuation coefficient is specified with a maximum value at one or more wavelengths in both
the 1310 nm and 1550 nm regions. The optical fibre cable attenuation coefficient values shall not
exceed the values found in clause 7.

Rec. ITU-T G.652 (11/2009)

5

NOTE – The attenuation coefficient may be calculated across a spectrum of wavelengths, based on
measurements at a few (3 to 4) predictor wavelengths. This procedure is described in clause 5.4.4 of
[ITU-T G.650.1] and an example is given in Appendix III of [ITU-T G.650.1].

6.2

Polarization mode dispersion coefficient

Cabled fibre polarization mode dispersion shall be specified on a statistical basis, not on an
individual fibre basis. The requirements pertain only to the aspect of the link calculated from cable
information. The metrics of the statistical specification are found below. Methods of calculations
are found in [b-IEC/TR 61282-3], and are summarized in Appendix IV of [ITU-T G.650.2].
The manufacturer shall supply a PMD link design value, PMDQ, that serves as a statistical upper
bound for the PMD coefficient of the concatenated optical fibre cables within a defined possible
link of M cable sections. The upper bound is defined in terms of a small probability level, Q, which
is the probability that a concatenated PMD coefficient value exceeds PMDQ. For the values of M
and Q given in clause 7, the value of PMDQ shall not exceed the maximum PMD coefficient
specified in clause 7.
Measurements and specifications on uncabled fibre are necessary, but not sufficient to ensure the
cabled fibre specification. The maximum link design value specified on uncabled fibre shall be less
than or equal to that specified for the cabled fibre. The ratio of PMD values for uncabled fibre to
cabled fibre depends on the details of the cable construction and processing, as well as on the mode
coupling condition of the uncabled fibre. [ITU-T G.650.2] recommends a low mode coupling
deployment requiring a low tension wrap on a large diameter spool for uncabled fibre PMD
measurements.
The limits on the distribution of PMD coefficient values can be interpreted as being nearly
equivalent to limits on the statistical variation of the differential group delay (DGD), that varies
randomly with time and wavelength. When the PMD coefficient distribution is specified for optical
fibre cable, equivalent limits on the variation of DGD can be determined. The metrics and values
for link DGD distribution limits are found in Appendix I.
NOTE 1 – PMDQ specification would be required only where cables are employed for systems that have the
specification of the max DGD, i.e., for example, PMDQ specification would not be applied to systems
recommended in [ITU-T G.957].
NOTE 2 – PMDQ should be calculated for various types of cables, and they should usually be calculated
using sampled PMD values. The samples would be taken from cables of similar construction.
NOTE 3 – The PMDQ specification should not be applied to short cables such as jumper cables, indoor
cables and drop cables.

7

Tables of recommended values

The following tables summarize the recommended values for a number of categories of fibres that
satisfy the objectives of this Recommendation. These categories are largely distinguished on the
basis of PMD requirements and attenuation requirement at 1383 nm. See Appendix I for
information about transmission distances and bit-rates relative to PMD requirements.
Table 1, ITU-T G.652.A attributes, contains the recommended attributes and values needed to
support applications such as those recommended in [ITU-T G.957] and [ITU-T G.691] up to
STM-16, as well as 10 Gbit/s up to 40 km (Ethernet) and STM-256 for [ITU-T G.693].
Table 2, ITU-T G.652.B attributes, contains recommended attributes and values needed to support
higher bit rate applications, up to STM-64, such as some in [ITU-T G.691] and [ITU-T G.692],
STM-256 for some applications in [ITU-T G.693] and [ITU-T G.959.1]. Depending on the
application, chromatic dispersion accommodation may be necessary.
Table 3, ITU-T G.652.C attributes, is similar to ITU-T G.652.A, but allows transmissions in
portions of an extended wavelength range from 1360 nm to 1530 nm.

Appendix I
Information for link attributes and system design
(This appendix does not form an integral part of this Recommendation)
A concatenated link usually includes a number of spliced factory lengths of optical fibre cable. The
requirements for factory lengths are given in clauses 5 and 6. The transmission parameters for
concatenated links must take into account not only the performance of the individual cable lengths
but also the statistics of concatenation.
The transmission characteristics of the factory length optical fibre cables will have a certain
probability distribution which often needs to be taken into account if the most economic designs are
to be obtained. This appendix should be read with this statistical nature of the various parameters in
mind.
Link attributes are affected by factors other than optical fibre cables, by such things as splices,
connectors and installation. These factors cannot be specified in this Recommendation. For the
purpose of link attribute values estimation, typical values of optical fibre links are provided in the
tables below. The estimation methods of parameters needed for system design are based on
measurements, modelling or other considerations.
I.1

Attenuation

The attenuation, A, of a link is given by:

A = αL + α s x + α c y
where:
α typical attenuation coefficient of the fibre cables in a link;
αs mean splice loss;
x number of splices in a link;
αc mean loss of line connectors;
y number of line connectors in a link (if provided);
L link length.
A suitable margin should be allocated for future modifications of cable configurations (additional
splices, extra cable lengths, ageing effects, temperature variations, etc.). The above equation does
not include the loss of equipment connectors. The typical values found in clause I.5 are for the
attenuation coefficient of optical fibre links. The attenuation budget used in designing an actual
system should account for the statistical variations in these parameters.
I.2

Chromatic dispersion

The chromatic dispersion in ps/nm can be calculated from the chromatic dispersion coefficients of
the factory lengths, assuming a linear dependence on length, and with due regard for the signs of the
coefficients (see clause 5.10).
When these fibres are used for transmission in the 1550 nm region, some forms of chromatic
dispersion compensation are often employed. In this case, the average link chromatic dispersion is
used for design purposes. The measured dispersion in the 1550 nm window can be characterized
within the 1550 nm window by a linear relationship with wavelength. The relationship is described
in terms of the typical chromatic dispersion coefficient and dispersion slope coefficient at 1550 nm.

Rec. ITU-T G.652 (11/2009)

11

Typical values for the chromatic dispersion coefficient, D1550, and chromatic dispersion slope
coefficient, S1550, at 1550 nm are found in Table I.1. These values, together with link length, LLink,
can be used to calculate the typical chromatic dispersion for use in optical link design.

DLink (λ ) = LLink [D1550 + S1550 (λ − 1550)] [ps/nm]
I.3

Differential group delay (DGD)

The differential group delay is the difference in arrival times of the two polarization modes at a
particular wavelength and time. For a link with a specific PMD coefficient, the DGD of the link
varies randomly with time and wavelength as a Maxwell distribution that contains a single
parameter, which is the product of the PMD coefficient of the link and the square root of the link
length. The system impairment due to PMD at a specific time and wavelength depends on the DGD
at that time and wavelength. So, means of establishing useful limits on the DGD distribution as it
relates to the optical fibre cable PMD coefficient distribution and its limits have been developed and
are documented in [b-IEC/TR 61282-3] and are summarized in Appendix IV of [ITU-T G.650.2].
The metrics of the limitations of the DGD distribution follow:
NOTE – The determination of the contribution of components other than optical fibre cable is beyond the
scope of this Recommendation, but is discussed in [b-IEC/TR 61282-3].

Reference link length, LRef: A maximum link length to which the maximum DGD and probability
will apply. For longer link lengths, multiply the maximum DGD by the square root of the ratio of
actual length to the reference length.
Typical maximum cable length, LCab: The maxima are assured when the typical individual cables of
the concatenation or the lengths of the cables that are measured in determining the PMD coefficient
distribution are less than this value.
Maximum DGD, DGDmax: The DGD value that can be used when considering optical system
design.
Maximum probability, PF: The probability that an actual DGD value exceeds DGDmax.
I.4

Non-linear coefficient

The effect of chromatic dispersion is interactive with the non-linear coefficient, n2/Aeff, regarding
system impairments induced by non-linear optical effects (see [ITU-T G.663] and
[ITU-T G.650.2]). Typical values vary with the implementation. The test methods for non-linear
coefficient remain under study.
I.5

Tables of common typical values

The values in Tables I.1 and I.2 are representative of concatenated optical fibre links according
to clauses I.1 and I.3, respectively. The implied fibre induced maximum DGD values in Table I.2
are intended for guidance in regard to the requirements for other optical elements that may be in the
link.
NOTE – Cable section length is 10 km except for the 0.10 ps/ km /> 4000 km link, where it is set to 25 km,
the error probability level is 6.5 × 10–8.
