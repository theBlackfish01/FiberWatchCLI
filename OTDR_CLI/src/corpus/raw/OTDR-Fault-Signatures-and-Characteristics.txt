OTDR Fault Signatures and Characteristics
Class 0 – Healthy Fiber (No Fault)
Trace Signature: A healthy fiber trace shows a steady, linear backscatter decline (slope) with no abrupt power drop-offs or spikes beyond normal connector reflections. The attenuation is uniform, typically around 0.2–0.4 dB/km for standard single-mode fiber (e.g. ~0.32 dB/km at 1310 nm, ~0.19 dB/km at 1550 nm)[1]. Connectors at fiber ends may appear as small events with minimal insertion loss (~0.2–0.5 dB) and low reflectance (high return loss, e.g. ?55 dB for UPC connectors)[2], but no unexpected anomalies are present.
Physics/Root Cause: This is the baseline trace caused by uniform Rayleigh backscattering and intrinsic fiber attenuation. Light scattering and absorption in the glass cause the gentle signal loss over distance[3]. No faults are present, so there are no localized losses or reflections beyond the intended connectors.
Remediation: None required. The fiber is performing normally. Ensure connectors remain clean and properly mated (per IEC 61300-3-35 inspection guidelines) to maintain low loss and high return loss. Continue routine monitoring.
Key Characteristics: Overall optical return loss (ORL) is high (indicating little reflected power) and within expected range. All observed connector losses and reflectances meet specifications (e.g. ?0.4 dB insertion loss, return loss ?55 dB for good UPC connections[2]). Fiber attenuation coefficient matches specified values for the fiber type[1], confirming no excess loss.
Class 1 – Splice Loss (Fusion or Mechanical Splice)
Trace Signature: A splice appears on an OTDR trace as a non-reflective abrupt drop (negative step) in the backscatter level. There is no sharp positive spike if the splice is a good fusion splice (since fused fibers have very low Fresnel reflection)[4]. The backscatter step magnitude corresponds to the insertion loss at that splice, typically on the order of 0.1–0.3 dB for a well-executed fusion splice[5]. In many cases a good fusion splice’s loss is so small (?0.1 dB) that it may be barely distinguishable on the trace[6][7]. Mechanical splices or poorly aligned splices can show higher loss (e.g. 0.3–0.5 dB or more) and may produce a small reflection if an air gap or index mismatch exists, though usually much less than a connector’s reflection.
Physics/Root Cause: A splice loss is caused by imperfect optical continuity between two fiber ends. Small lateral or angular core misalignments, end-separation gaps, core diameter (MFD) differences, or imperfect index matching result in some optical power not coupling into the downstream fiber, manifesting as a loss[8][9]. Fusion splices melt fibers together, minimizing these discontinuities (hence very low reflectance, often < –50 dB[10]). Mechanical splices rely on physical alignment and index gel, typically yielding slightly higher loss and a minor Fresnel reflection (reflectance on the order of –30 to –40 dB if not perfectly mated).
Remediation: Recommended actions to address high splice loss: - Re-splice the fibers: If loss is above acceptable limits (e.g. >0.3 dB), cleave the fibers again and perform a new fusion splice. Ensure fiber end-faces are cleaved cleanly at 90° and free of dirt. - Verify fiber compatibility: Check that the spliced fibers are of the same type (e.g. both ITU G.652.D). Large mode field diameter differences can cause excess splice loss[9]; if so, expect higher loss or consider using matching fiber or specialized splicing programs. - Optimize fusion parameters: Use the splicer’s loss estimation and adjust settings (e.g. alignment, fusion current) if splices consistently show high loss. For mechanical splices, try re-seating the fiber and ensure index matching gel is properly applied. - Inspect for fiber damage: A poor splice could indicate a fiber end defect (crack, dirt). Re-cleave or cut back the fiber to fresh glass if necessary.
Key Numeric Ranges: Modern fusion splices typically have insertion loss <0.1–0.2 dB (average ~0.05–0.1 dB)[11][5]. Field fusion splices are often accepted if ?0.3 dB. Reflectance for a good fusion splice is usually better than –50 dB (often effectively negligible)[10]. Mechanical splices may have ~0.2–0.5 dB loss and reflectance around –35 dB (higher if index gel is absent)[12]. Splice losses should appear nearly equal when measured from either end; any large discrepancy or a “gainer” (apparent negative loss) indicates backscatter coefficient mismatch, and true loss is found by averaging bi-directional results[13][14].
Class 2 – Connector Reflection (Connector Pair or Open Connector)
Trace Signature: A connector interface produces a distinct Fresnel reflection spike on the OTDR trace[15]. This appears as a sharp upward deflection at the connector’s location, often towering above the Rayleigh backscatter level. It is followed by an immediate backscatter level drop corresponding to the connector’s insertion loss (typically a small step, ~0.2–0.5 dB drop if it’s a low-loss connection). The reflectance magnitude (spike height) depends on connector type and condition: a clean physical contact (PC/UPC) connector might show a modest spike (reflectance ~–40 to –50 dB), whereas an unmated or poorly mated connector (air gap) can approach a much larger reflection (e.g. –14 dB, equivalent to 4% Fresnel reflection from glass-air)[16]. The OTDR event trace for a mated connector typically shows both a loss and a reflection in the event table.
Physics/Root Cause: Connector reflections are caused by a refractive index discontinuity at a fiber joint – essentially a tiny Fabry-Perot interface. When light goes from the glass core (n?1.46) to an air gap or less-than-perfect contact, a portion is reflected back (Fresnel reflection)[15]. Even with physical contact polish connectors, microscopic air gaps or mismatches can reflect some light. UPC (ultra-physical contact) connectors are flat-polished to minimize this, yielding return loss ~50–55 dB[2] (very little reflected power). APC (angled physical contact) connectors angle the fiber end (~8°) to deflect reflections out of the fiber core, achieving return losses of 60–65 dB[2]. However, any dirt, damage, or poor mating will degrade the contact, creating a partial air gap and dramatically increasing reflectance (i.e. a bigger spike) while also often increasing insertion loss.
Remediation: To address high connector reflectance or loss: - Clean the connectors: Dirty end-faces are the #1 cause of high reflectance. Use fiber optic cleaning swabs or cassette cleaners and inspect with a microscope (per IEC 61300-3-35). Even a tiny speck can cause major reflections and loss[17]. - Reconnect or tighten: Ensure the connector is fully seated and tightened (for connectors with screw coupling). Improper seating can leave a gap. Remate the connection after cleaning; slight rotations during reconnect can sometimes improve contact. - Replace or re-polish connectors: If a connector is physically damaged (scratched or pitted ferrule end), it may need re-termination. For critical links, consider using APC connectors to inherently reduce reflectance. - Use index-matching caps for open ports: An open connector (unmated end) will create a large reflection (like a fiber break). If a port must remain open, use a terminator or dummy load (an index-matching cap or angled stub) to eliminate the open-air interface.
Key Numeric Ranges: A good mated connector pair typically has insertion loss ?0.4 dB (Telcordia GR-326 specifies ?0.4 dB)[2] and reflectance better than –45 dB (UPC) or –60 dB (APC)[2]. By contrast, a poor or dirty connection might have loss in the 1–3 dB range and reflectance degrading to –20 dB or worse (in extreme cases approaching the –14 dB Fresnel limit for a fully open end)[18][17]. An open connector (one fiber end open to air) will behave like a fiber break: typically ~–14 dB reflectance spike[16]. In all cases, the OTDR’s reflective event dead zone means closely spaced connectors will blur together if not spaced by more than the specified dead zone (which grows with reflection magnitude and pulse width)[19][20].
Class 3 – Macro-Bend (Macroscopic Bend Loss)
Trace Signature: A macro-bend on the OTDR trace manifests as a localized loss event without reflection. It often appears as a gentle or step-like power drop at a particular distance, similar in shape to a splice loss but usually larger in magnitude and highly wavelength-dependent. Notably, the loss from a macrobend is much greater at longer wavelengths (e.g. 1550 nm or 1625 nm) than at 1310 nm[21][22]. For example, a bend that might introduce virtually no loss at 1310 nm could cause several dB of loss at 1550 nm. On a single-wavelength OTDR, a significant sudden attenuation with no reflection is a clue; confirmation comes by comparing traces at two wavelengths. A difference >0.2 dB in loss at the same location between 1310 and 1550 nm is a tell-tale sign of a macro-bend[23]. The trace beyond the bend may show a higher attenuation slope if the bend is severe (since some modes are stripped out).
Physics/Root Cause: Macrobending occurs when the fiber is bent with a radius of curvature that is too small, causing some of the guided light to radiate out of the core. At longer wavelengths, the mode field is larger and less tightly confined, so it “leaks” from the core more readily when the fiber is bent[24][21]. Thus, 1550 nm (and 1625 nm) experience much higher bend loss than 1310 nm in standard single-mode fiber. Common causes are fibers bent around tight corners, kinked jumper cables, or coiled into small loops (e.g. inside a closure or patch panel) beyond their specified minimum bend radius. The loss is generally gradual (not a discrete break), and there is no Fresnel reflection because the fiber remains continuous; the light is lost to the cladding and jacket as heat or scattering, not reflected backward[25].
Remediation: Steps to mitigate macro-bends: - Locate and re-route fiber: Use the OTDR distance to find the physical location. Often it’s a splice tray, patch panel, or a tight cable tie wrap. Reposition the fiber or loosen the routing to increase the bend radius. - Adhere to minimum bend radius: Ensure the fiber cable isn’t bent sharper than its spec (typically ~30 mm radius for standard SMF)[26]. Replace any too-small cable guides or re-lay the fiber in larger loops. Use strain reliefs to avoid acute bends. - Deploy bend-insensitive fiber if needed: In tight installations (FTTH, small enclosures), consider using ITU-T G.657 A/B bend-insensitive fibers which can tolerate smaller radii with low loss[26][27]. - Environmental check: Temperature fluctuations can tighten existing coils (thermal contraction). Secure slack fiber to avoid slipping into smaller loops. Also ensure no heavy objects or lids press the fiber into a bend.
Key Numeric Ranges: Standard single-mode (ITU G.652.D) fiber is usually specified to have negligible loss at ?30 mm bend radius (e.g. <0.1 dB at 1625 nm for 100 turns of 60 mm diameter)[26]. However, bends tighter than ~20–30 mm radius can cause rapidly increasing loss. For instance, one turn on a 10 mm radius can induce on the order of 0.5–1 dB loss at 1550 nm (even in bend-insensitive fiber)[27]. A classic macrobend might show, say, ~0.05 dB loss at 1310 nm but several dB at 1550 nm[21][23]. Reflectance is essentially none for a pure bend (the OTDR event will report reflectance below detection)[25]. Importantly, macrobend loss is reversible – if the fiber is re-bent to a safe radius, the loss disappears – so a bend fix should restore trace to normal. Long-term, repeated bending can weaken fiber mechanically (static fatigue), so avoid bends tighter than recommended (generally ?30 mm radius for long-term reliability in OSP cables[28]).
Class 4 – Micro-Bend (Microbending Loss)
Trace Signature: Microbending losses are more subtle and distributed than macrobends. On an OTDR trace, a severe microbend may not show up as a distinct isolated event; instead one might observe a section of fiber with higher attenuation (the backscatter slope steepens) or small, irregular drops in power. Sometimes these are labeled as “stress events.” Microbends typically do not produce any reflection (the fiber is not cut or broken). If multiple microbends are present along a length, the trace can appear noisy or simply exhibit excess attenuation over that span. A key indicator is that the loss does not increase as dramatically with wavelength as a macro-bend does – microbend-induced attenuation tends to affect 1310 nm and 1550 nm more uniformly (though 1550 nm is still somewhat worse)[29][30]. In practice, microbends are often diagnosed by process of elimination: if a fiber shows unexplained gradual loss and all splices/connectors check out, microbending (perhaps due to tight cabling or pressure) is suspected.
Physics/Root Cause: Microbending refers to many tiny deflections or pressure points along the fiber that cause light to leak out of the core in small increments[31]. These can be caused by external forces such as fiber pressed against a rough surface, cable jacket shrinkage, tight zip-ties, or even cold temperatures causing differential contraction in a cable. The bends involved are microscopic (radius <1 mm, essentially micro-curvatures) and random[32][33]. They induce mode coupling and radiation of light out of the core similar to macro-bends, but each microbend perturbs only a small portion of light. The cumulative effect is an increased attenuation over some length rather than one big loss point[31]. Because microbends perturb higher-order modes slightly more, the wavelength dependency is milder than macro-bends (loss might increase 1.2× at 1550 nm vs 1310 nm, rather than an order of magnitude difference)[29][34]. Microbending is often exacerbated at low temperatures as materials contract and squeeze the fiber[35].
Remediation: How to reduce microbending loss: - Relieve pressure on fiber: Check for overly tight ties, staples, or clamps on the fiber cable. Loosen or remove them. In patch panels or closures, ensure the fiber isn’t pinched between trays or under other cables. - Re-lay or rewrap fiber slack: If excess loss is in a buffer tube or spool, rewrap the fiber more loosely. Use larger bend radii for routing even if microbends are the issue; sometimes what appears to be microbend loss can be mitigated by gentle re-coiling (since micro and macro bends often coexist[36]). - Improve cushioning: In cables, microbends can happen if the fiber isn’t well cushioned. Ensure proper strain-relief on cables. In cold environments, use cables rated for low-temp that have buffer tubes designed to minimize microbend stress. - Fiber selection: Newer bend-insensitive fibers (ITU G.657) have design features (like trench-index profiles or larger mode fields) that greatly reduce microbend sensitivity[37][30]. Consider using such fibers or better coatings if microbending is a persistent issue (e.g. inside high-fiber-count ribbons or tight buffer cables).
Key Numeric Ranges: Microbend loss is not as standardized as macrobend; it’s often characterized by test scenarios (e.g. induced attenuations under specified conditions). Typically, a good fiber/cable will have minimal microbend loss at ambient conditions (e.g. additional attenuation ?0.05 dB/km). However, under stress or cold, poor cables might see a microbend-induced attenuation increase of a few tenths of a dB/km or more. For example, particle pressure tests (wire mesh wraps) might induce an extra ~0.1–0.5 dB/km at 1550 nm[38][37]. Unlike macro-bends, microbend loss scales less with wavelength – a microbend might cause, say, 0.5 dB/km at 1310 nm and 0.7 dB/km at 1550 nm (only ~1.4× higher)[36]. There is no reflectance associated with pure microbending. If an OTDR does show a small reflective component, the event is likely a mix of microbend plus a physical interface (e.g. fiber pressed against a connector or a cracked fiber). Generally, maintaining proper cable handling (no tight pinching, adequate buffer) keeps microbend loss negligible in a healthy link.
Class 5 – Dirty Connector / High Reflectance Noise
Trace Signature: This fault typically appears as an extremely strong reflective spike at a connector interface, often reaching the OTDR’s saturation point. The reflection may be so large that the OTDR receiver is temporarily blinded, resulting in a characteristic flat-topped peak with a trailing tail on the trace[4]. In other words, the top of the spike is clipped and the backscatter immediately after the event is noisy or depressed due to the detector recovering from overload. The insertion loss at that connector may also be high (the trace may drop significantly after the spike, indicating that little light is continuing forward). Essentially, it looks like an exaggerated Class 2 event: a huge Fresnel reflection (like an open fiber) occurring where a connector should be, combined with subsequent trace instability. This is a hallmark of a dirty or bad connector – the contamination prevents proper contact, creating an air gap (hence high reflectance) and potentially loss/unreliable readings beyond that point.
Physics/Root Cause: A contaminated connector (dirt, oil) or a damaged/faulty connector causes a poor mating interface, often leaving a microscopic gap or misalignment. This yields a Fresnel reflection approaching that of an open fiber end (reflectance can degrade to ~–20 dB or worse, compared to the normal –40 dB or better)[17]. The high reflectance sends a large pulse of optical energy back to the OTDR. If the reflection is powerful enough, it saturates the photodiode and analog front end[19], leading to a brief “dead zone” where the instrument cannot measure attenuation accurately[39]. The result is the flat-top spike and recovery tail artifact on the trace[4]. The noise and fluctuation in the trace after the event (sometimes called ringing or overload distortion) is due to the OTDR’s receiver slowly recovering equilibrium after the blinding flash. High reflectance events also increase overall link ORL, which can cause instability in lasers or transceivers in live systems.
Remediation: To fix a dirty connector or high reflectance issue: - Immediate cleaning: Disconnect the link (both sides) and clean the connector end-faces thoroughly. Use proper fiber cleaning tools (isopropyl alcohol or dry cleaning pads, lint-free swabs for female ports). Then inspect with a fiberscope – ensure no debris or residue remains[17]. Many high-reflectance issues resolve simply with cleaning. - Connector repair or replacement: If cleaning doesn’t reduce the reflection, the connector may be physically scratched, chipped, or not an APC when it should be. Re-polish the ferrule or install a new connector/pigtail as needed. For persistent reflectance, upgrading to APC connectors at that interface can help. - Verify mating adapter and alignment: Sometimes the adapter or bulkhead can be damaged (bent sleeve) leading to poor fiber contact. Ensure the connector is the correct type and fully inserted. Replace the mating adapter if suspect. - Measure after remedial action: After cleaning/replacing, perform an OTDR trace again or use an optical return loss meter to verify that reflectance is back within spec (e.g. ORL >50 dB at that joint).
Key Numeric Ranges: A “clean” connector typically has reflectance around –45 dB (0.003% reflection) or better[2]. A dirty connector can deteriorate to –20 dB (~1% reflection) or even worse, effectively behaving like an open flat connector (~–14 dB)[16][17]. In terms of insertion loss, contamination can cause losses multiple times higher than normal – studies show particles can increase IL by up to 10× and drop return loss by 3×[17] (for example, a connector that should be 0.2 dB loss might become 2 dB loss when dirty). The OTDR trace may show a post-event recovery tail lasting several hundred meters in severe cases (depending on pulse width and saturation level), effectively increasing the attenuation dead zone to that length[19][40]. After remediation, the reflectance should return to ~–40 dB or better, and the overload artifact disappears. Maintaining connectors per IEC standards (cleanliness, no scratches in core zone) ensures reflectance stays low and avoids such noise events[17].
Class 6 – Fiber Break (Open Fiber End)
Trace Signature: A fiber break is characterized by a sudden end to the trace accompanied by a large reflection at the break point. On the OTDR, it appears as a dramatic spike at the fiber’s end distance, after which no further backscatter is seen (the trace drops to the noise floor). The reflection is usually one of the largest on the trace because an open fiber-air interface reflects a significant fraction of light. A clean break (cleaved fiber) gives a strong Fresnel return, often on the order of –14 dB reflectance (about 4% of the pulse)[16]. This is seen as a tall spike. If the fiber break is not open to air (for example, broken but end facet touching something with index matching), the reflection might be lower, but typically field breaks are open. The OTDR will often measure this as an “end-of-fiber” event with very high loss (essentially the remaining fiber past the break is lost). In summary: huge end reflection and trace terminates immediately at that point.
Physics/Root Cause: A fiber break means the continuous path of the fiber is severed. Common causes are physical strain (cable cuts, rodent chews, crack from bending stress) or connector/fiber coming unplugged. The break introduces a glass-to-air interface. When the OTDR pulse hits this interface, a portion of light reflects straight back (like a mirror) while the rest escapes out of the fiber end. A flat (90°) break will reflect ~4% (Fresnel reflectance at fiber/air)[18]. An angled break or APC end will reflect far less (e.g. an APC polished end in air might reflect ~–45 dB)[18], but most accidental breaks aren’t nicely angled. Since no fiber continues, no backscatter exists beyond the break, creating the characteristic end-stop of the trace.
Remediation: Restoration steps for a fiber break: - Locate the break: The OTDR gives a distance to the break. Use that to pinpoint the physical location (e.g. 5.23 km from launch). Verify with visual fault locator (VFL) if possible – a red laser can often be seen at the break point. - If accessible, splice it: For buried or aerial cable, excavate or access the break location. Prepare the fiber ends and perform a fusion splice to rejoin, adding a splice closure around that point. Use an OTDR launch/tail cord for accurate placement and loss measurement of the new splice. - If not accessible (e.g. within a device): If the break is at a connector or in a pigtail, replace the broken component (e.g. replace the patchcord or pigtail). For a break at the end connector, you may need to re-terminate the fiber with a new connector. - Test after fix: After repairing, re-test the fiber. The large reflective spike should be gone (or moved to the new cable end if you spliced in a test tail). Verify all characteristics (attenuation, splice loss) are within norms.
Key Numeric Ranges: An open fiber break typically shows reflectance around –14 dB for a normal cleave[18] (return loss ~14 dB in positive terms). If the break was at an APC connector, reflectance could be better (~–45 dB)[18], but that is an unusual scenario for a break. The loss at the break is essentially the remaining span beyond – a 100% loss of downstream fiber (which OTDR might report as a very large dB loss or simply “end of fiber”). The distance resolution of the break depends on pulse width; a typical OTDR can locate a break within a few meters accuracy on a long line. After repair via splicing, expect a normal splice signature (e.g. <0.2 dB loss, minimal reflection if fusion). Note that without a receive fiber past the break, the OTDR’s one-way measurement underestimates the true loss a bit due to no backscatter beyond (requiring LSA fit or bidirectional test for absolute accuracy)[41][42]. In summary, the fiber break is identified by the end reflection of high magnitude and no signal afterward – a definitive fault that necessitates fiber restoration.
Class 7 – Unknown / Composite Fault
Trace Signature: An “unknown” or composite fault indicates an OTDR event that does not cleanly match a single known signature. The trace in such a case might show multiple overlapping features at one location or an unusual shape. For example, you might see a moderate reflection accompanied by an unexpectedly large loss, or a reflective event followed very closely by another event, making interpretation difficult. The OTDR’s event analysis may flag it as unknown if it cannot distinguish if it’s a splice, a connector, or a bend. Composite faults can occur when two issues coincide – e.g. a dirty connector that is also under bending stress could show a big reflection and extra loss (reflective + non-reflective components). Ghost reflections (echoes from strong reflectors) can also appear as mysterious events at non-physical distances[6], contributing to confusion. In essence, the trace pattern is irregular or ambiguous: e.g. a spike that doesn’t correspond to a connector in the route, or a sudden power drop with a small reflection where a pure splice or pure bend would not reflect.
Physics/Root Cause: Composite faults often arise from multiple simultaneous fault conditions. For instance, a connector that is misaligned (high loss) and dirty (high reflectance) at the same time will produce a signature combining both behaviors. Similarly, a fiber pinch could cause both a microbend loss and also slightly separate the fiber at a connector, adding a reflection. OTDR limitations can label events as “unknown” if they occur within the instrument’s dead zone or if two events are closer than the resolution. Overlapping events (e.g. a bad splice only a meter away from a connector) might merge in the trace. Ghost artifacts (where a strong reflection bounces multiple times in the fiber) can create a “ phantom” spike that doesn’t correspond to a real physical fault[6]. All these make the trace deviate from standard single-fault signatures.
Remediation: Troubleshooting an unknown/composite fault: - Cross-verify with bi-directional OTDR or alternative tests: Measure the link from the opposite end if possible. A confusing event might resolve into clearer separate events from the other side (especially for two closely spaced issues). - Perform manual inspection at suspected location: Physically check the hardware at the reported distance. You may find, for example, a connector in a patch panel that is both dirty and bent, etc. Inspect connectors, splices, and fiber routing near that location. - Isolate segments: If feasible, test the fiber in sections. For example, use a fiber break locator or cut the fiber (as last resort) at an intermediate point to test subsections, to pinpoint which part contains the anomaly. - Address potential causes one by one: Clean any connector at or near that location (even if it didn’t obviously show a reflection, cleaning can’t hurt). Re-splice any nearby splice. Remove any tight bends in the vicinity. Essentially eliminate possible faults to see if the trace normalizes. - Consult OTDR vendor event analysis: Some modern OTDR software can decompose events (e.g. “reflective loss event” indicating both a reflection and loss). Use high resolution (short pulse) to attempt separating closely spaced events.
Key Points: An unknown or composite event doesn’t have fixed numeric ranges since it’s a combination. However, you can often break it down: e.g. Reflectance: If a spike is present, estimate its reflectance (dB) – is it in the range of a connector (~–40 dB) or nearly open (~–20 to –14 dB)? Loss: Evaluate the drop in dB around the event – is there a significant step (indicative of a splice/bend)? If the reflectance is high and loss is high, you likely have a dirty/bad connector giving both (composite). If reflectance is low or zero but OTDR marks “unknown,” it could be two closely spaced non-reflective events (like two splices very close, or a splice plus a bend). The tell-tale feature is inconsistency with standard patterns. As a guideline, whenever an OTDR shows an unfamiliar signature, suspect multiple simultaneous faults or measurement artifacts. Systematically removing/cleaning potential faults will usually unravel the composite signature into recognizable components.

Summary Table of Fault Classes
Class IDFault TypeOTDR Trace Features (Tell-tale signs)0Healthy (No fault)Steady backscatter decline (normal fiber attenuation); no sudden drops or spikes except minor connector events within spec. Trace is smooth and low noise.1Splice LossNon-reflective negative step (backscatter drop) at splice location. Small loss (~0.1–0.3 dB for fusion). Essentially no Fresnel spike (fusion splice reflectance very low).2Connector ReflectionSharp positive Fresnel reflection spike at connector interface, typically followed by a slight drop (insertion loss). Reflectance depends on connector (~–40 dB for good UPC). Clear reflective event in trace/event table.3Macro-bendLocalized attenuation (loss event with no reflection) caused by fiber bent too tightly. Appears as a step or slope increase in loss. Wavelength dependent: loss much higher at 1550 nm than 1310 nm. Confidently identified by multi-wavelength comparison (>0.2 dB extra loss at longer ?).4Micro-bendDistributed or small-scale loss (no distinct event spike). May show as a gradual loss over a segment or slight noise, without reflection. Less wavelength-sensitive than macro-bend (loss increase more uniform across ?). Often associated with fiber under pressure or tight confines.5Dirty/High-Reflectance ConnectorVery large reflective spike (often saturating OTDR) at a connector, with a flat-top and trailing tail on trace. Accompanied by higher insertion loss at that point and unstable or noisy trace beyond due to detector overload. Indicates bad/contaminated connector causing near-open reflectance.6Fiber BreakSudden end-of-trace with a strong reflection at the break. No signal past this point. The last event is a huge Fresnel spike (open fiber ~–14 dB reflectance). Essentially 100% loss of further fiber – the trace flatlines after.7Unknown/Composite FaultIrregular or mixed signature that doesn’t match a single fault type. Possibly overlapping events (e.g. reflection + loss together) or ghost echoes. OTDR may label it “unknown.” Requires detailed analysis – suspect multiple faults in close proximity or instrument artifact.
